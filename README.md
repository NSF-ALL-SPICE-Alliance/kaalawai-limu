In the late 1930s the estate of Doris Duke was built. A large mansion on five acres of beach from property. That was the first large construction in the shoreline of Kaalawai. Significant modifications to the shoreline were made. Including the destination of the reef and shoreline to build a personal cove to protect her fleet of boats.
