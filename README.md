# kalawai-limu
Background

Kaalawai Beach, known for its unique marine environment, is home to a variety of endemic seaweed (limu) species that play a vital role in the local ecosystem. A critical place for cultural and recreation practices preserving this area is important. One identifier for ecosystem health is seaweed(limu). Seaweed species, especially endemic ones, can be sensitive indicators of environmental changes, particularly temperature and salinity variations. Understanding how these factors impact seaweed abundance is critical to both conservation and sustainable management efforts. 
Problem Statement:
Despite their ecological significance, there is limited research on how temperature and salinity influence the abundance of endemic seaweed species at Kaalawai Beach. With climate change and increasing ocean temperatures, there is an urgent need to monitor these factors and understand their long-term impact on local seaweed populations. Specific species including Halimeda discoidea, Acanthophora spicifera, and Bryopsis Pennata are good indicators of bioproductivity within the area.

Objectives

To identify and catalog endemic seaweed species at Kaalawai Beach.
To monitor changes in seaweed abundance over time concerning sea temperature and salinity.
To establish baseline data for future monitoring and conservation efforts.

Research Questions

What are the key endemic seaweed species found at Kaalawai Beach?
How do seasonal changes in sea temperature and salinity correlate with variations in seaweed abundance?
Are there specific temperature and salinity ranges that correlate with increased or decreased abundance of specific seaweed species?

Methodology

Study Duration
Two years (24 months) to capture seasonal and interannual variability.
Study Site
Location: Kaalawai Beach, Oahu, Hawaii
Coordinates: [Provide specific GPS coordinates]
Data Collection Methods

Environmental Data Collection

Instruments: HOBO data loggers will be deployed at multiple depths and locations to capture high-resolution sea temperature and salinity data.
Frequency: Loggers will collect data every 15 minutes to account for diurnal and seasonal fluctuations.
Calibration and Maintenance: Loggers will be checked and calibrated quarterly to ensure data accuracy.

Seaweed Abundance and Identification

Method: Manual collection and identification will be conducted bi-monthly, with transects set up in both shallow and intertidal zones at Kaalawai Beach.
Transect Design: At each sampling event, two transects (50 meters each) will be surveyed at random locations to document species presence, abundance, and coverage.
Identification: Collected seaweed samples will be identified to species level using local guides and expert consultation. Voucher specimens will be preserved and stored for future reference.

Data Analysis

Abundance Assessment: Relative abundance will be calculated for each species based on transect counts and coverage estimations.
Statistical Analysis: Using a mixed-effects model, the study will analyze the effects of temperature and salinity on seaweed abundance, controlling for seasonal and spatial variations.

Expected Outcomes

Species Catalog: A comprehensive list of endemic seaweed species at Kaalawai Beach, with an emphasis on documenting species of ecological or cultural importance.
Environmental Trends: Analysis of how temperature and salinity impact seaweed abundance over time, with specific thresholds identified for optimal growth conditions.
Baseline Data: Foundational data to support future monitoring and conservation initiatives, providing insight into the potential impacts of climate change on local marine biodiversity.

Significance of Study


Chaminade's school of Natural sciences and mathematics may partake in this study not only to increase the opportunity for students to partake in significant research but also to provide meaningful data to communities and regulatory organizations. This study will generate valuable insights into the effects of environmental variables on endemic seaweed populations, contributing to the broader understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics in Hawaii. The findings will support local conservation efforts and inform sustainable resource management strategies. Leading to a better management of resources such as fish and limu that are traditionally used for sustenance. Additionally, this research aligns with global climate change studies by highlighting the importance of monitoring marine biodiversity. Aligning the focus of SDG goal 13 climate action. By better understanding the effect of climate change on small scale areas like Kaalawai. Insights may bring to light further knowledge on
